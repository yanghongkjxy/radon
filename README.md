# OverView
RadonDB is an open source, Cloud-native MySQL database for unlimited scalability and performance.

## what is RadonDB?

RadonDB is a cloud-native database based on MySQL，and architected in fully distributed cluster that enable unlimited scalability (scale-out), capacity and performance. It supported distributed transaction that ensure high data consistency, and leveraged MySQL as storage engine for trusted data reliability. RadonDB is compatible with MySQL protocol, and sup-porting automatic table sharding as well as batch of automation feature for simplifying the maintenance and operation workflow.

## Feature

* **Automatic Table Sharding**: automatically sharding (partition) across nodes that minimizing the complexity of maintenance and operation.
* **Distributed Transaction**: supporting distributed transaction across shards (partitions) and securing Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) for whole transaction process.
* **Connection Thread Pool**: presetting a set of connected threads that can be lever-aged to accelerating the efficiency of connection between SQL cluster and storage nodes; supporting automatic reconnection and thread reuse.
* **Auditing and Logging**: Users can choose to enable this function for auditing and logging the SQL query operation in multiple dimensions: query event time, operations statement type, consuming time, etc; this function help to secure operation safety and data compliance; the auditing log is able to be set in multiple modes for high flexibility: read (SQL) only, write only, or read/write simultaneously.


## Architecture

## Overview
RadonDB is a new generation of distributed relational database (MyNewSQL) based on MySQL. It was designed to create the open-source database our developers would want to use: one that has features such as financial high availability、
large-capacity database、automatic plane split table、 scalable and strong consistency, this guide sets out to detail the inner-workings of the radon process as a means of explanation.


## SQL Layer

### SQL support
On SQL syntax level, RadonDB Fully compatible with MySQL.You can view all of the SQL features RadonDB supports here  [radon_sql_support](docs/radon_sql_support.md)

###  SQL parser, planner, executor

After your SQL node  receives a SQL request from a mysql client via proxy, RadonDB parses the statement, creates a query plan, and then executes the plan.

``` Parsing ```

Received queries are parsed by sqlparser (which describes the supported syntax by mysql) and generated Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).


``` Planning ```

With the AST, RadonDB begins planning the query's execution by generating a tree of planNodes.
This step also includes steps analyzing the client's SQL statements against the expected AST expressions, which include things like type checking.

You can see the a query plan  generates using `EXPLAIN`(At this stage we only use `EXPLAIN` to  analysis  Table distribution).

``` Excuting ```
Executing an Executor in a storage layer in Parallel with a Distributed Execution Plan.

### SQL with Transaction
The SQL node is stateless, but in order to guarantee transaction `Snapshot Isolation`, it is currently a write-multiple-read mode.


## Transaction Layer

``` Distributed transaction```

RadonDB provides distributed transaction capabilities. If the distributed executor at different storage nodes and one of the nodes failed to execute, then operation of the rest nodes will be rolled back, This guarantees the atomicity of operating across nodes  and makes the database in a consistent state.

```Isolation Levels```

RadonDB achieves the level of SI (Snapshot Isolation) at the level of consistency. As long as a distributed transaction has not commit, or if some of the partitions have committed, the operation is invisible to other transactions.

``` Transaction with SQL Layer```

The SQL node is stateless, but in order to guarantee transaction `Snapshot Isolation`, it is currently a write-multiple-read mode.
